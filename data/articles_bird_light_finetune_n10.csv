A consistently used rafting area just offshore of Hanalei, on the north shore of Kauai, is described for the first time. Observations made there in June and July 1993 and 1994, indicate that the population frequenting breeding colonies, on the order of >1000 birds per night during the peak of the visitation cycle, is much larger than previously thought. In contrast, few sigh tings of this species were made elsewhere around the island. Corroborating these observations were records collected by state and federal biologists on fledglings attracted to lights during their initial flight, 1980-1993, indicating a virtual confinement of the population to the north shore. Data presented also indicate that the nesting season on Kauai may be a few weeks later than on Maui, the only locale where extensive research has been conducted on this species. On Kauai, increasing numbers of Hawaiian Petrel fledglings are being found each year. We propose that this is a result of the increasing numbers of coastal lights, and not an increase in the petrel's population. The increasing numbers found have implications for conservation of this species' population on Kauai.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

The photocatalytic properties of the photocatalysts are evaluated by the degradation of refractory azo-dye methyl orange (MO), hexavalent chromium Cr(VI), and bisphenol A (BPA) in water under visible light irradiation. It is found that the as-prepared composite with 4 wt% CNTs shows an optimal photocatalytic performance, and its photocatalytic activity is 30% higher than that of pure Bi4VO8Cl. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the synergetic effects induced by increased light absorption, increased adsorption efficiency for pollutant, and suppressed recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, efficient removals of Cr(VI), bisphenol A (BPA), and combined contamination of Cr(VI) and BPA over CNTs/Bi4VO8Cl composite further confirm that the degradation of organic pollutants is a photocatalytic mechanism rather than photosensitization of dye. Of particular importance is that removal efficiency of single pollutant can be promoted by the coexistence of the Cr(VI) and organics. The mechanism of synergetic promotion is discussed and attributed to the accelerated separation of charge carriers resulted from their simultaneously being captured by pollutants. Moreover, the CNTs/Bi4VO8Cl composite exhibits good stability and recycling performance in the photocatalytic degradation process. Therefore, the composite photocatalysts developed in the present work are expected to have the potential in purification of complex wastewater.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Excluded""}",,,,

However, few studies have demonstrated a link between carotenoid display and the quantity or quality of resources provided to the offspring. The present study investigated the expression of a carotenoid-based ornament, the breast plumage yellowness of the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, in relation to the level of parental provisioning effort and the amount of carotenoid-rich prey provided to the young. The study was conducted in two forest types (evergreen and deciduous), which also allowed an exploration of the possible existence of habitat effects on the coloration of breeding birds. It was found that plumage colour intensity (carotenoid chroma) correlated positively with nestling provisioning rates of both males and females, supporting the good parent hypothesis. In addition, carotenoid chroma was positively related with the proportion of Lepidoptera larvae brought to the nest in both sexes. Female but not male coloration was positively linked to breeding success (proportion of fledged young). Nestling coloration did not correlate with that of their parents, nor the frequency with which they were fed. Hue and lightness of nestling's plumage correlated positively with body mass and tarsus length, respectively. The results obtained in the present study indicate that ventral plumage coloration in blue tits may advertise the ingested carotenoids (carotenoid foraging ability) and also their overall parental quality in terms of nestling provisioning rates. This suggests that plumage yellowness can be used as an indicator of foraging ability in this species.

Most studies on mechanisms that generate such scattered nests within a colony have primarily focused on the measurement of distance related to the intensity of interactions among conspecific neighbors. However, these interactions can change not only with distance between nests but also with other factors. In particular, whether the nest is hidden from neighbors can strongly affect the intensity of interaction for birds that usually use sight for communication. To show the possible benefit of nesting at sites hidden from neighboring nests, we studied the nest arrangements and settlement patterns within a barn swallow colony. We tested whether the swallows prefer nesting at sites hidden from neighboring nests in cattle barns that are often used as colony sites by the swallows in Japan. We found that the sides of ceiling beams hidden from neighbors were preferred as nesting sites. A randomization test suggested that the rectangular sections occupied by swallows were not spaced out within a colony. The results suggested that the swallows preferred nesting sites hidden from their neighbors and did not space out their nests within a colony. This paper also refutes intraspecific brood parasitism as a plausible function of this behavior.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Excluded""}",,Deglutition,,

Mechanical stimuli activate specialized cutaneous end organs in the bill, innervated by trigeminal afferents. We report that trigeminal ganglia (TG) of domestic and wild tactile-foraging ducks exhibit numerical expansion of large-diameter mechanoreceptive neurons expressing the mechano-gated ion channel Piezo2. These features are not found in visually foraging birds. Moreover, in the duck, the expansion of mechanoreceptors occurs at the expense of thermosensors. Direct mechanical stimulation of duck TG neurons evokes high-amplitude depolarizing current with a low threshold of activation, high signal amplification gain, and slow kinetics of inactivation. Together, these factors contribute to efficient conversion of light mechanical stimuli into neuronal excitation. Our results reveal an evolutionary strategy to hone tactile perception in vertebrates at the level of primary afferents.",,,,,
