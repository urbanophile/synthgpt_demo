A consistently used rafting area just offshore of Hanalei, on the north shore of Kauai, is described for the first time. Observations made there in June and July 1993 and 1994, indicate that the population frequenting breeding colonies, on the order of >1000 birds per night during the peak of the visitation cycle, is much larger than previously thought. In contrast, few sigh tings of this species were made elsewhere around the island. Corroborating these observations were records collected by state and federal biologists on fledglings attracted to lights during their initial flight, 1980-1993, indicating a virtual confinement of the population to the north shore. Data presented also indicate that the nesting season on Kauai may be a few weeks later than on Maui, the only locale where extensive research has been conducted on this species. On Kauai, increasing numbers of Hawaiian Petrel fledglings are being found each year. We propose that this is a result of the increasing numbers of coastal lights, and not an increase in the petrel's population. The increasing numbers found have implications for conservation of this species' population on Kauai.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Furthermore, bird fatalities often occur as consequence of electrocution. Therefore, equipment damages, economical losses of industry and electric corporations and bird deaths persuaded the main electric distribution operator and the regulator to implement management programs of storks' activities in the vicinity of electric distribution substructure to minimize stork fatalities and energy outages. Stork management in electric distribution networks is implemented by using sounds, strobes, vibration and turbine devices. These systems are activated upon storks approaching the putative nesting sites. The storks are detected by ultrasonic sensor probes. Sound equipment was modified as specifically required to allow remote control and monitoring via Internet connection. Particularly effective were strong harassment sounds, e.g. guns, alarms, sirens, and dynamic powerful musical passages. Natural distress calls of herons and egrets were also effective. Ultrasonic frequencies, predator sounds (falcons, hawks) and general bird distress calls (gulls, pigeons, starlings) were of limited effects. To keep birds from adapting to routine patterns, the devices were activated only upon approaching detected by ultrasonic probes, and a random combination of 8 sound pieces played for 10 min. Novel vibration platforms proved effective in preventing nesting and roosting, but relatively difficult to install with the current prototype design. Specially designed powered turbines powered by a high torque motor effectively prevented storks from nesting, in spite of several attempts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Predation risk is strongly determined by light conditions, and some animals are nocturnal to reduce predation. Artificial lights and its consequent light pollution may disrupt this natural behavior. Here, we used 13 years of attendance data to study the effects of sun, moon, and artificial light on the attendance pattern of a nocturnal seabird, the little penguin Eudyptula minor at Phillip Island, Australia. The little penguin is the smallest and the only penguin species whose activity on land is strictly nocturnal. Automated monitoring systems recorded individually marked penguins every time they arrived (after sunset) at or departed (before sunrise) from 2 colonies under different lighting conditions: natural night skylight and artificial lights (around 3 lux) used to enhance penguin viewing for ecotourism around sunset. Sunlight had a strong effect on attendance as penguins arrived on average around 81 min after sunset and departed around 92 min before sunrise. The effect of moonlight was also strong, varying according to moon phase. Fewer penguins came ashore during full moon nights. Moon phase effect was stronger on departure than arrival times. Thus, during nights between full moon and last quarter, arrival times (after sunset) were delayed, even though moonlight levels were low, while departure times (before sunrise) were earlier, coinciding with high moonlight levels. Cyclic patterns of moon effect were slightly out of phase but significantly between 2 colonies, which could be due to site-specific differences or presence/absence of artificial lights. Moonlight could be overridden by artificial light at our artificially lit colony, but the similar amplitude of attendance patterns between colonies suggests that artificial light did not mask the moonlight effect. Further research is indeed necessary to understand how seabirds respond to the increasing artificial night light levels.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Although a wide array of components contribute to the physiognomy of urban habitats, our knowledge of the habitat features that affect bird communities within urban areas is biased to vegetation. In this study, we measured 33 habitat characteristics that describe the spatial distribution of urban components, habitat structure, biological heterogeneity, potential hazards for birds, housing density, and socioeconomic level of three neotropical cities to define the relative role that vegetation and non-vegetation habitat features have on abundant, moderately abundant, and rare bird species. Our results show that bird species richness and abundances are positively related to vegetation cover and human prosperity, and negatively related to highly developed urban areas with intense human activities and high abundance of cats and dogs. We found six urban infrastructure variables related to bird species richness and abundances: (a) number of electric and telephone cables, lighting rods, and building height were positively related to abundant species, (b) electric and telephone poles and building cover were negatively related to moderately abundant species, and (c) lamp poles were negatively related to rare species, while electric and telephone poles were positively related. Our results revealed that abundant bird species were only related to urban infrastructure features (i.e., cables, lightning rods, building height), while moderately abundant and rare species were related to habitat structure and urban-related hazards, showing that life-history traits affect how species respond to urbanization. Based on our study, we suggest some urban management and planning policies, including: the increase of tree and shrub cover throughout cities, allowing shrubs and herbs to grow in areas restricted to pedestrians, controlling homeless dogs and restricting off-leash dogs, and considering the need of homogenizing the ecological quality throughout cities, regardless of socioeconomic boundaries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Methods We included 1,956 seabirds (133 dead on admission and 1,823 admitted alive) in this study. Causes of morbidity were classified into nine categories: light pollution (fallout), fishing gear interaction, crude oil, poisoning/intoxication, other traumas, metabolic/ nutritional disorder, orphaned young birds, other causes, and unknown/undetermined. The crude and stratified (by causes of admission) rates of the three final disposition categories (euthanasia Er, unassisted mortality M-r, and release R-r), the time until death, and the length of stay were also studied for the seabirds admitted alive. Results Yellow-legged Gull (Larus michahellis) was the species most frequently admitted (46.52%), followed by Cory's Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea borealis) (20.09%). The most frequent causes of morbidity were light pollution (fallout) (25.81%), poisoning/intoxication (24.69%), and other traumas (18.14%). The final disposition rates were: E-r = 15.35%, M-r = 16.29%, and R-r = 68.34%. The highest E-r was observed in the 'other traumas' category (58.08%). Seabirds admitted due to metabolic/ nutritional disorder had the highest M-r (50%). The highest R-r was observed in the light pollution (fallout) category (99.20%). Conclusions This survey provides useful information for the conservation of several seabird species. We suggest that at least the stratified analysis by causes of admission of the three final disposition rates, and the parameters time until death and length of stay at the center should be included in the outcome research of the rehabilitation of seabirds. The high release rate for seabirds (68.34%) achieved at the TWRC emphasizes the importance of wildlife rehabilitation centers for the conservation of seabirds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,Retrospective Studies;Spain,,

We found Lapland longspur carcasses distributed around the drilling rig from 33m to 171m. Investigators did not find evidence of bird carcasses on the drilling rig deck or equipment immediately adjacent to the drilling rig. We ruled out chemical toxins and disease as a cause of mortality. Weather conditions, the circular depositional pattern of carcasses around the drilling rig, and bird necropsy results led investigators to conclude that the Lapland longspur mortality was the result of the migrating birds entering the area illuminated by the drilling rig lights in freezing fog and the birds repeatedly circling the drilling rig until they fell to the ground in exhaustion and dying from subsequent trauma.

Barriers to movement may be caused by artificial light, which is known to disrupt bird, sea turtle, and bat behavior, but few studies have experimentally investigated the effects of artificial light on movement for a suite of terrestrial vertebrates. Therefore, we studied the effect of ecological light pollution on animal usage of a bridge under-road passage structure. On a weekly basis, sections of the structure were subjected to different light treatments including no light added, followed by a Reference period when lights were off in all the structure sections. Sand track data revealed use by 23 mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, nine of which had >30 tracks for species-level analysis. Columbia black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus) traversed under unlit bridge sections much less when neighboring sections were lit compared to when none were, suggesting avoidance due to any nearby presence of artificial light. Similarly, deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and opossum (Didelphis virginiana) track paths were less frequent in the lit sections than the ambient. Crossing was correlated with temporal or spatial factors but not light for three of the other species. These findings suggest that artificial light may be reducing habitat connectivity for some species though not providing a strong barrier for others. Such information is needed to inform mitigation of habitat fragmentation in the face of expanding urbanization. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, no studies have quantified avian responses to powerful ground-based light sources in urban areas. We studied effects of ALAN on migrating birds by monitoring the beams of the National September 11 Memorial & Museum's ""Tribute in Light"" in New York, quantifying behavioral responses with radar and acoustic sensors and modeling disorientation and attraction with simulations. This single light source induced significant behavioral alterations in birds, even in good visibility conditions, in this heavily photopolluted environment, and to altitudes up to 4 km. We estimate that the installation influenced approximate to 1.1 million birds during our study period of 7 d over 7 y. When the installation was illuminated, birds aggregated in high densities, decreased flight speeds, followed circular flight paths, and vocalized frequently. Simulations revealed a high probability of disorientation and subsequent attraction for nearby birds, and bird densities near the installation exceeded magnitudes 20 times greater than surrounding baseline densities during each year's observations. However, behavioral disruptions disappeared when lights were extinguished, suggesting that selective removal of light during nights with substantial bird migration is a viable strategy for minimizing potentially fatal interactions among ALAN, structures, and birds. Our results also highlight the value of additional studies describing behavioral patterns of nocturnally migrating birds in powerful lights in urban areas as well as conservation implications for such lighting installations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

For birds, ultraviolet (UV) light is important for a number of their behaviors, including mate selection, foraging, and nesting. Many captive birds, however, are housed indoors without access to natural light and without UV-supplemented lighting; a practice which may negatively impact their welfare. Understanding how birds use UV light, and assessing its relative importance, is necessary to provide optimal care in captive settings. Accordingly, we tested the preference for UV light shown by 67 birds housed at Lincoln Park Zoo, Chicago, USA, and its impact on their behavior. We tested 18 species which represented three natural ecologies typified by different natural light levels: high light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in savannas or seashores), patchy light dwellers (e.g., birds that live in forested areas), and circumpolar dwellers (e.g., birds that live near the poles). Experiment 1 investigated the birds' lighting preferences through simultaneous presentation of areas of their exhibit lit with supplemental ultraviolet light (UV+ zone) and with standard artificial light. Experiment 2 investigated the impact of supplemental UV light on these birds' behavioral repertoire. Birds from high light and circumpolar environments showed a preference for the side of their enclosure to which UV light was added. High light birds were recorded in the UV+ zone during 64% trials and, similarly, circumpolar birds were observed in this UV+ zone for 61% of trials; a significant preference for UV+ zone, P < 0.001 for both. Perhaps mimicking their natural habitat of part-sun and part-shade, in Experiment 1 birds from patchy light environments split their time evenly within their enclosure (they were recorded in the UV+ zone for 54% of trials). When in an environment with added UV light, birds from patchy light habitats were more sociable: the percentage of their observation trials spent in proximity and in contact with other birds increased from 5% to 11% (P = 0.026). Although certain birds showed a preference for the added UV light, none showed changes in their behavioral repertoire beyond the sociability measure. We discuss this preference for UV-supplemented environments and the management implications for zoos and other captive facilities which house birds indoors. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In birds, it has been hypothesized that artificial light at night can affect daily aspects of behaviour, but one caveat is the lack of knowledge about the light intensity that wild animals, such as birds, are exposed to during the night. Organisms have naturally evolved daily rhythms to adapt to the 24-h cycle of day and night, thus, it is important to investigate the potential shifts in daily cycles due to global anthropogenic processes such as urbanization. We captured adult male European blackbirds (Turdus merula) in one rural forest and two urban sites differing in the degree of anthropogenic disturbance. We tagged these birds with light loggers and simultaneously recorded changes in activity status (active/non-active) through an automated telemetry system. We first analysed the relationship between light at night, weather conditions and date with daily activity onset and end. We then compared activity, light at night exposure and noise levels between weekdays and weekends. Onset of daily activity was significantly advanced in both urban sites compared to the rural population, while end of daily activity did not vary either among sites. Birds exposed to higher amounts of light in the late night showed earlier onset of activity in the morning, but light at night did not influence end of daily activity. Light exposure at night and onset/end of daily activity timing was not different between weekdays and weekends, but all noise variables were. A strong seasonal effect was detected in both urban and rural populations, such as birds tended to be active earlier in the morning and later in the evening (relative to civil twilight) in the early breeding season than at later stages. Our results point at artificial light at night as a major driver of change in timing of daily activity. Future research should focus on the costs and benefits of altered daily rhythmicity in birds thriving in urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

However, in experiments to date, the effectiveness of light in eliciting an avoidance or dispersal response in birds has varied by species and context. To effectively use light in managing avian conflicts with humans, a better understanding of the complexities of avian retinal physiology relative to phototaxic responses to the environment is necessary. My objectives are to provide an overview of research pertaining to 1) anatomical features of the avian eye and 2) the ecological implications of retinal wavelength sensitivity, and 3) discuss the application of light for resolving avian conflicts with humans. I also suggest that future evaluations of light-based management methods for birds should include integration of aposematic colors and color pattern treatments for seeds and in combination with chemical repellents, as well as quantification of the effects of light wavelength, pulse frequency, and beam configurations of lasers, and aircraft-mounted light in eliciting avian dispersal and avoidance behavior.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Little empirical research exists, however, examining the mechanisms by which birds might be deterred from human structures. We tested the efficacy of ultraviolet (UV) lights for preventing window strikes in an urban environment by measuring their deterrence effect at bird feeders at eight residential sites. We used remote cameras to count feeder visits over one winter in response to rotating treatments comprising a pulsating UV light, a light-reflecting compact disc, an unlit UV light as a novel object, and a control with no object. Using generalized linear mixed models, we showed that feeder visit rates were influenced by wind speed, site, and site-treatment interactions. The unlit novel object treatment yielded a visitation rate significantly higher than the control (p = 0.01). The UV and passive reflecting treatments slightly increased visitation above the control (p = 0.06 and p = 0.378, respectively). This suggests that novel objects may serve as an attractant in a foraging context and that this effect is stronger than any deterrence effect of UV light. The site-treatment interaction indicated that each of the four treatments produced the highest visitation rate for at least one of the sites. Rather than offer a biological explanation for this interaction, we speculate that it resulted from a spurious effect of temporal and spatial variation in bird activity that interacted with our randomized block design. Although we found no evidence that UV lights would deter urban songbirds from anthropogenic structures, their potential to attract attention may reduce the likelihood that birds fail to see and then collide with windows.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,Ultraviolet Rays,,

However, pre-exposure to red light for 1 h immediately before the critical tests under red light of 6-7x10(15) quanta s(-1) m(-2) enabled robins to orient in their seasonally appropriate migratory direction in spring as well as in autumn. Pre-exposure to darkness, by contrast, failed to induce orientation under red light. Under green light of 7x10(15) quanta s(-1) m(-2), the birds were oriented in their migratory orientation after both types of pre-exposure.

Light pollution can lead to massive mortality episodes for nocturnally active petrels, one of the most threatened avian groups. Some fledglings can be attracted or disoriented by artificial light on their first flights. Studies testing the effect of artificial light characteristics on attractiveness to seabirds have not provided conclusive results and there is some urgency as some endangered petrel species experience high light-induced mortality. We designed a field experiment to test the effect of three common outdoor lighting systems with different light spectra (high pressure sodium, metal halide and light emitting diode) on the number and the body condition of grounded fledglings of the short-tailed shearwater Ardenna tenuirostris. A total of 235 birds was grounded during 99 experimental hours (33 h for each treatment). 47% of birds was grounded when metal halide lights were on, while light emitting diode and high pressure sodium lights showed lower percentages of attraction (29% and 24%). Metal halide multiplied the mortality risk by a factor of 1.6 and 1.9 respectively in comparison with light emitting diode and high pressure sodium lights. No differences in body condition were detected among the birds grounded by the different lighting systems. We recommend the adoption of high pressure sodium lights (or with similar spectra) into petrel-friendly lighting designs together with other light mitigation measures such as light attenuation, lateral shielding to reduce spill and appropriate orientation.

Under low monochromatic light from the short-wavelength part of the visual spectrum, migratory birds show orientation in their migratory direction. Under monochromatic light of higher intensity, however, they showed unusual preferences for other directions or axial preferences. To determine whether or not these responses are still controlled by the respective light regimes, European robins, Erithacus rubecula, were tested under UV, Blue, Turquoise and Green light at increasing intensities, with orientation in migratory direction serving as a criterion whether or not magnetoreception works in the normal way. Results: The birds were well oriented in their seasonally appropriate migratory direction under 424 nm Blue, 502 nm Turquoise and 565 nm Green light of low intensity with a quantal flux of 8.10(15) quanta s(-1) m(-2), indicating unimpaired magnetoreception. Under 373 nm UV of the same quantal flux, they were not oriented in migratory direction, showing a preference for the east-west axis instead, but they were well oriented in migratory direction under UV of lower intensity. Intensities of above 36.10(15) quanta s(-1) m(-2) of Blue, Turquoise and Green light elicited a variety of responses: disorientation, headings along the east-west axis, headings along the north-south axis or 'fixed' direction tendencies. These responses changed as the intensity was increased from 36.10(15) quanta s(-1) m(-2) to 54 and 72.10(15) quanta s(-1) m(-2). Conclusion: The specific manifestation of responses in directions other than the migratory direction clearly depends on the ambient light regime. This implies that even when the mechanisms normally providing magnetic compass information seem disrupted, processes that are activated by light still control the behavior. It suggests complex interactions between different types of receptors, magnetic and visual. The nature of the receptors involved and details of their connections are not yet known; however, a role of the color cones in the processes mediating magnetic input is suggested.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Fledglings of burrow-nesting seabirds, and to a lesser extent adults, are attracted to and then grounded (i.e., forced to land) by lights when they fly at night. We reviewed the current state of knowledge of seabird attraction to light to identify information gaps and propose measures to address the problem. Although species in families such as Alcidae and Anatidae can be grounded by artificial light, the most affected seabirds are petrels and shearwaters (Procellariiformes). At least 56 species of Procellariiformes, more than one-third of them (24) threatened, are subject to grounding by lights. Seabirds grounded by lights have been found worldwide, mainly on oceanic islands but also at some continental locations. Petrel breeding grounds confined to formerly uninhabited islands are particularly at risk from light pollution due to tourism and urban sprawl. Where it is impractical to ban external lights, rescue programs of grounded birds offer the most immediate and employed mitigation to reduce the rate of light-induced mortality and save thousands of birds every year. These programs also provide useful information for seabird management. However, these data are typically fragmentary, biased, and uncertain and can lead to inaccurate impact estimates and poor understanding of the phenomenon of seabird attraction to lights. We believe the most urgently needed actions to mitigate and understand light-induced mortality of seabirds are estimation of mortality and effects on populations; determination of threshold light levels and safe distances from light sources; documentation of the fate of rescued birds; improvement of rescue campaigns, particularly in terms of increasing recovery rates and level of care; and research on seabird-friendly lights to reduce attraction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

In 2011, only 13 live Atlantic Puffins were captured despite nightly search efforts throughout the fledging period; this low capture rate was attributed to poor breeding success at the colony. In contrast, in 2012, 414 live fledgling puffins were captured and successfully released between 6 August and 5 September; 388 of these were banded and weighed prior to release.

From an ecological perspective, this is light pollution, which causes changes in reproductive physiology, migration and foraging of many species and ultimately leads to loss of biodiversity. Some seabirds are intimately linked with the light features of their environments because they are nocturnally active. We report light-induced groundings of Cory's shearwater (Calonectris diomedea) during a 2-year study (2008 and 2009) in Sao Miguel Island, in the Azores archipelago, and investigate the spatial correlation of locations of grounded birds with an annual composite of remotely sensed stable lights. Results indicate that 16.7% of fledglings are attracted to lights. The exposure of shearwater colonies in the study area to artificial night lighting is low overall. Four colonies account for 87% of the grounded birds. The distance each bird was found from the closest colony was best explained by the ratio of the satellite-measured light levels at the grounding spot to the light levels at the assigned colony of origin. These results demonstrate that satellite-observed nighttime lights are sufficient to assess risk to marine birds at the scale of oceanic islands and indicate their utility for monitoring the effectiveness of programs to manage lighting to reduce risk for these species and conducting global assessments of species vulnerability. To minimize the impact on Cory's shearwater and other marine birds, we recommend measures such as reduction and control of lighting intensity near colony locations, while continuing and re-enforcing rescue campaigns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Aircraft lighting has been proposed as a potential means of enhancing avian responses to aircraft. Determining the optimal changes to lighting to reduce bird strikes is a complicated problem because avian visual systems differ markedly from that of humans. Icteridae, including Brown-headed Cowbirds (Molothrus ater; hereafter ""cowbirds''), are involved in bird strikes, have a well-described visual system, and respond to approaching vehicles and lights. Our goal was to assess cowbirds' responses to a remote-controlled (RC) aircraft fitted with lights tuned to the cowbird eye. On the basis of perceptual modeling (i.e. visual physiology, object and background reflectance, and ambient light conditions), we found that 470-nm lights (""blue'' portion of the human spectrum) would be the most conspicuous wavelength for cowbirds. We used field experiments to examine cowbird response to 470-nm light treatments. Cowbirds exhibited alert behaviors to a stationary RC aircraft with lights on (both continuous and pulsing) in less than half the time they took to do so with lights off. In response to an approaching RC aircraft, cowbird alert responses were delayed at higher aircraft speeds with the lights off, and we noted a less pronounced speed effect with pulsing lights. However, this interaction effect of aircraft speed and lighting was eliminated with continuous lights. Additionally, higher ambient noise levels delayed cowbirds' avoidance responses to the RC aircraft, possibly influencing cowbird behavior as a sensory distractor. We suggest that some types of lighting may enhance the birds' detection and visual tracking of aircraft at high speeds and, thus, holds some potential as a means of reducing the frequency of bird strikes. This sensory-based approach also has implications for management of other bird-object collision problems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

Testing chickens under monochromatic 465 nm blue and 645 nm red light suggested a wavelength dependence, with orientation possible under blue but not under red light. Exposing chickens to an oscillating field of 1.566 MHz led to disorientation, identifying an underlying radical pair mechanism. Local anesthesia of the upper beak, where iron-rich structures have been described as potential magnetoreceptors, did not affect the performance, suggesting that these receptors are not involved in compass orientation. These findings show obvious parallels to the magnetic compass described for European robins, indicating that chickens and small passerines use the same type of magnetic compass mechanism.

Environmental assessments for oil and gas projects in the region predict insignificant adverse effects on marine birds from oil spills, incineration in platform flares and collisions. Limited baseline data on seasonal occupancies and a failure to quantify the nature and extent of marine bird attraction to platforms and related mortality undermines these assessments. We conducted 22 surveys to offshore platforms on the Grand Bank during 1999-2003 to measure avian associations with platforms and to determine the level of monitoring needed to assess the risks to marine birds. We document seasonal shifts in marine bird occurrences and higher densities of auks (fall) and shearwaters (summer) around platforms relative to surrounding areas. The limited temporal and spatial coverage of our surveys is more robust than existing industry monitoring efforts, yet it is still inadequate to quantify the scale of marine bird associations with platforms or their associated mortality risks. Systematic observations by independent biologists on vessels and platforms are needed to generate reliable assessments of risks to marine birds. Instead, the regulatory body for offshore oil and gas in eastern Canada (Canada - Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board; C-NLOPB) supports industry self-reporting as the accepted form of environmental monitoring. Conflicting responsibilities of oil and gas regulatory agencies for both energy development and environmental monitoring are major barriers to transparency, unbiased scientific inquiry and adequate environmental protection. Similar conflicts with the oil and gas regulatory body in the United States, the former Minerals and Management Service (MMS) were identified by the U.S. President as a major contributor to the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

To avoid delays in consenting processes and to streamline the construction and operation phase, functional mitigation measures are required which efficiently reduces bird mortality. Vision is the primary sensory system in birds, which for a number of species also includes the ultraviolet spectrum. Many bird species that are known to collide with offshore wind turbines are sensitive in the violet or ultraviolet spectrum. For species that are mainly active at lower ambient light levels, lighting may deter birds from the lit area. Utilizing (ultra) violet lights may in addition not disturb humans. However, we do not know whether UV-sensitive birds in flight actually respond behaviourally to UV lights. Methods: We therefore tested the efficacy of two types of lights within the violet (400 nm) and ultraviolet (365 nm) spectrum to deter birds from the lit area. These lights were placed vertically and monitored continuously between dusk and dawn using an avian radar system. Results: Relative to control nights, bird flight activity (abundance) was 27% lower when the ultraviolet light was on. Violet light resulted in a 12% decrease in overall abundance, and in addition, a vertical displacement was seen, increasing the average flight altitude by 7 m. Although temporal changes occurred, this effect persisted over the season below 40 m above sea level. Conclusions: Although the results from this pilot study are promising, we argue there still is a long way to go before a potentially functional design to mitigate collisions that has proven to be effective in situ may be in place.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,,,

This paper proposes further details of audio visual warnings, including directional lights, which will enhance the learning process and act as warnings. The leading edges and the peripheral regions of the blades are most likely to strike birds and bats, which may be trained to keep away by the colors, lighting and sounds of leading edges. Lights and sounds need only have a range of a few tens of meters and directionality towards the danger zone, meaning the lights and sounds will be imperceptible to humans in the vicinity.

We summarize information from the scientific literature and technical reports and also present new information from recently analyzed data to assess the magnitude and scope of mortality. Fisheries bycatch was responsible for the highest levels of incidental take of migratory bird species; estimated combined take in the longline, gillnet, and bottom otter trawl fisheries within the Atlantic, including the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and Pacific regions was 2679 to 45,586 birds per year. For the offshore oil and gas sector, mortality estimates ranged from 188 to 4494 deaths per year due to the discharge of produced waters resulting in oil sheens and collisions with platforms and vessels; however these estimates for the oil and gas sector are based on many untested assumptions. In spite of the uncertainties, we feel levels of mortality from these two industries are unlikely to affect the marine bird community in Canada, but some effects on local populations from bycatch are likely. Further research and monitoring will be required to: (1) better estimate fisheries-related mortality for vulnerable species and populations that may be impacted by local fisheries, (2) determine the effects of oil sheens from produced waters, and attraction to platforms and associated mortality from collisions, sheens, and flaring, so that better estimates of mortality from the offshore oil and gas sector can be obtained, and (3) determine impacts associated with accidental spills, which are not included in our current assessment. With a better understanding of the direct mortality of marine birds from industry, appropriate mitigation and management actions can be implemented. Cooperation from industry for data collection, research to fill knowledge gaps, and implementation of mitigation approaches will all be needed to conserve marine birds in Canada.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Included""}",,Canada;Military Personnel,,

The photocatalytic properties of the photocatalysts are evaluated by the degradation of refractory azo-dye methyl orange (MO), hexavalent chromium Cr(VI), and bisphenol A (BPA) in water under visible light irradiation. It is found that the as-prepared composite with 4 wt% CNTs shows an optimal photocatalytic performance, and its photocatalytic activity is 30% higher than that of pure Bi4VO8Cl. The enhanced photocatalytic activity is ascribed to the synergetic effects induced by increased light absorption, increased adsorption efficiency for pollutant, and suppressed recombination rate of photogenerated charge carriers. Furthermore, efficient removals of Cr(VI), bisphenol A (BPA), and combined contamination of Cr(VI) and BPA over CNTs/Bi4VO8Cl composite further confirm that the degradation of organic pollutants is a photocatalytic mechanism rather than photosensitization of dye. Of particular importance is that removal efficiency of single pollutant can be promoted by the coexistence of the Cr(VI) and organics. The mechanism of synergetic promotion is discussed and attributed to the accelerated separation of charge carriers resulted from their simultaneously being captured by pollutants. Moreover, the CNTs/Bi4VO8Cl composite exhibits good stability and recycling performance in the photocatalytic degradation process. Therefore, the composite photocatalysts developed in the present work are expected to have the potential in purification of complex wastewater.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Excluded""}",,,,

However, few studies have demonstrated a link between carotenoid display and the quantity or quality of resources provided to the offspring. The present study investigated the expression of a carotenoid-based ornament, the breast plumage yellowness of the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus, in relation to the level of parental provisioning effort and the amount of carotenoid-rich prey provided to the young. The study was conducted in two forest types (evergreen and deciduous), which also allowed an exploration of the possible existence of habitat effects on the coloration of breeding birds. It was found that plumage colour intensity (carotenoid chroma) correlated positively with nestling provisioning rates of both males and females, supporting the good parent hypothesis. In addition, carotenoid chroma was positively related with the proportion of Lepidoptera larvae brought to the nest in both sexes. Female but not male coloration was positively linked to breeding success (proportion of fledged young). Nestling coloration did not correlate with that of their parents, nor the frequency with which they were fed. Hue and lightness of nestling's plumage correlated positively with body mass and tarsus length, respectively. The results obtained in the present study indicate that ventral plumage coloration in blue tits may advertise the ingested carotenoids (carotenoid foraging ability) and also their overall parental quality in terms of nestling provisioning rates. This suggests that plumage yellowness can be used as an indicator of foraging ability in this species.

Most studies on mechanisms that generate such scattered nests within a colony have primarily focused on the measurement of distance related to the intensity of interactions among conspecific neighbors. However, these interactions can change not only with distance between nests but also with other factors. In particular, whether the nest is hidden from neighbors can strongly affect the intensity of interaction for birds that usually use sight for communication. To show the possible benefit of nesting at sites hidden from neighboring nests, we studied the nest arrangements and settlement patterns within a barn swallow colony. We tested whether the swallows prefer nesting at sites hidden from neighboring nests in cattle barns that are often used as colony sites by the swallows in Japan. We found that the sides of ceiling beams hidden from neighbors were preferred as nesting sites. A randomization test suggested that the rectangular sections occupied by swallows were not spaced out within a colony. The results suggested that the swallows preferred nesting sites hidden from their neighbors and did not space out their nests within a colony.

These features are not found in visually foraging birds. Moreover, in the duck, the expansion of mechanoreceptors occurs at the expense of thermosensors. Direct mechanical stimulation of duck TG neurons evokes high-amplitude depolarizing current with a low threshold of activation, high signal amplification gain, and slow kinetics of inactivation.

The objective of this study was to determine if using an all-natural nonphosphate blend (SavorPhos-200, SP) in water-based (WB) and oil-based (OB) marinades would perform better than a commercial phosphate blend (PB). The treatments included WB+PB (water, 0.4% phosphate, 0.7% salt), WB+SP (water, 0.5% SavorPhos-200, 0.7% salt), OB+PB (water, 3% oil, 0.4% phosphate, 0.7% salt), and OB+SP (water, 3% oil, 0.5% SavorPhos-200, 0.7% salt). The rotisserie chickens and BSB were injected with a multineedle injector to 20% (wt/wt) pickup at a constant pressure (103-138 kPa). The parameters measured were marinade pickup %, 20-min and 24-h marinade retention %, and cook loss %. Color, tenderness, total moisture, and sensory test were conducted on BSB. Data were analyzed within marinade type (WB and OB). Rotisserie birds picked up and retained the same yield in WB marinades. In OB marinades, SP had higher yields postinjection and lower cook loss % than the PB, while retaining the same yield over 24 h. For BSB, the cook loss was lower in SP than the PB in WB marinades. Higher yields postinjection were achieved with OB, but had the same retention 20 min and 24 h postinjection and cook loss % as the PB. No differences were observed for total moisture or L* (lightness) within marinade type and treatment. Texture was lower, indicating increased tenderness (P < 0.05) on SP samples in both marinades. However, consumers were not able to distinguish between treatments in sensory analyses. Therefore, SavorPhos-200 can be used as a natural nonphosphate blend in WB marinades with no detriment to yield. In addition, SavorPhos-200 can be used as a natural nonphosphate blend in OB marinades with yield improvements.",,,Phosphates,,

The major limitation on the accuracy of the structure-factor measurements is uncertainty in the Debye-Waller factors describing the temperature-dependent atomic vibrations. While X-ray and neutron diffraction techniques are both capable of accurate measurements of Debye-Waller factors, the frequent use of liquid-nitrogen-cooled samples in CBED experiments means that previous measurements are rarely available at the temperatures required. This has prompted attempts to determine Debye-Waller factors from electron diffraction data obtained under experimental conditions that match those used for the quantitative CBED work. In this paper, the possibility of extracting accurate Debye-Waller factors from the low-order reflections of a zone-axis CBED pattern is investigated. In this way, the Debye-Waller factors and structure factors could be obtained from the same data set.

Leaner females were more likely to engage in extra-pair behavior and fledged more nestlings, but did not differ in structural size from females that did not engage in extra-pair behavior, suggesting that female mass is an important predictor of mating decisions and fitness for these aerial insectivores. Male body condition was not related to male extra-pair behavior.

The pineals were cultured in a superfusion system under different light conditions. Additionally, some explants were treated with norepinephrine. The pineal glands of 1-day-old ducks released melatonin in a well-entrained, regular rhythm during incubation under a 12 hrs light : 12 hrs dark cycle and adjusted their secretory activity to a reversed 12 hrs dark : 12 hrs light cycle within 2 days. In contrast, the diurnal changes in melatonin secretion from the pineals of 9-month-old ducks were largely irregular and the adaptation to a reversed cycle lasted 3 days. The pineal organs of nestling and adult ducks incubated in a continuous light or darkness secreted melatonin in a circadian rhythm. The treatment with norepinephrine during photophases of a light-dark cycle resulted in: 1) a precise adjustment of melatonin secretion rhythm to the presence of this catecholamine in the culture medium, 2) a very high amplitude of the rhythm, 3) a rapid adaptation of the pineal secretory activity to a reversed light-dark cycle. The effects of norepinephrine were similar in the pineal organs of nestlings and adults. In conclusion, melatonin secretion in the duck pineal organ is controlled by three main mechanisms: the direct photoreception, the endogenous generator and the noradrenergic transmission.

Given the growing availability of complete vertebrate genomes, comparative genomics represents a promising approach to address this question. Here we used genomics and molecular approaches to study how ion channel genes influence the properties of the brain circuitry that regulates birdsong, a learned vocal behavior with important similarities to human speech acquisition. We focused on potassium (K-)Channels, which are major determinants of neuronal cell excitability. Starting with the human gene set of K-Channels, we used cross-species mRNA/protein alignments, and syntenic analysis to define the full complement of orthologs, paralogs, allelic variants, as well as novel loci not previously predicted in the genome of zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). We also compared protein coding domains in chicken and zebra finch orthologs to identify genes under positive selective pressure, and those that contained lineage-specific insertions/deletions in functional domains. Finally, we conducted comprehensive in situ hybridizations to determine the extent of brain expression, and identify K-Channel gene enrichments in nuclei of the avian song system. Results: We identified 107 K-Channel finch genes, including 6 novel genes common to non-mammalian vertebrate lineages. Twenty human genes are absent in songbirds, birds, or sauropsids, or unique to mammals, suggesting K-Channel properties may be lineage-specific. We also identified specific family members with insertions/deletions and/or high dN/dS ratios compared to chicken, a non-vocal learner. In situ hybridization revealed that while most K-Channel genes are broadly expressed in the brain, a subset is selectively expressed in song nuclei, representing molecular specializations of the vocal circuitry. Conclusions: Together, these findings shed new light on genes that may regulate biophysical and excitable properties of the song circuitry, identify potential targets for the manipulation of the song system, and reveal genomic specializations that may relate to the emergence of vocal learning and associated brain areas in birds.",,,Potassium Channels;Genome;Genomics;Brain,,

Because AIV circulating in wild birds pose an indirect threat to agriculture and human health, understanding the ecology of AIV and developing risk assessments and surveillance systems for prevention of disease is critical. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, mallards were experimentally infected with an H4N6 subtype of AIV by oral inoculation or contact with an H4N6 contaminated water source. Cloacal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs, fecal samples, and water samples were collected daily and tested by real-time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR) for estimation of viral shedding. Fecal samples had significantly higher virus concentrations than oropharyngeal or cloacal swabs and 6 month old ducks shed significantly more viral RNA than 3 month old ducks regardless of sample type. Use of a water source contaminated by AIV infected mallards, was sufficient to transmit virus to naive mallards, which shed AIV at higher or similar levels as orally-inoculated ducks. Conclusions: Bodies of water could serve as a transmission pathway for AIV in waterfowl. For AIV surveillance purposes, water samples and fecal samples appear to be excellent alternatives or additions to cloacal and oropharyngeal swabbing. Furthermore, duck age (even within hatch-year birds) may be important when interpreting viral shedding results from experimental infections or surveillance.

Hypotheses based on innate consumer preferences have been tested and rejected. Though colour itself plays an important role in animal foraging, it is only one component of signals. Another major component are colour contrasts against background achieving the conspicuousness of signals. In order to evaluate which signal component determines consumers behaviour, we measured fruit colour and colour contrasts of 43 species against their natural background under ambient light conditions. Red and black fruits exhibit stronger contrasts and are therefore more conspicuous to consumers than fruits of other colours. Subsequently, trials were carried out to determine whether colour or conspicuousness influences avian food choice. Four bird species strongly preferred contrasting red-green or black-green over uni-coloured red, green, or black fruit displays, while no preference for particular hues was found. We therefore hypothesize that conspicuousness determines avian food selection and define the contrast hypothesis: Diurnal dispersers select fruit colours based on their conspicuousness and not their colour itself. Because colour vision is an ancient trait, the entire heterogeneous group of frugivorous birds most likely perceives conspicuousness uniformly over evolutionary time spans.

The major advantages which result from the use of composite materials in the design and fabrication of covered hopper cars for the railroad industry, such as weight savings, fuel savings, corrosion resistance and lower maintenance costs, are discussed. The selection of materials, e.g. reinforcements, resins and adhesives, and the processes used in the construction of the two cars, are summarized. Nonproprietary design features of the Glasshopper are presented and a comparison of the Glasshopper with conventional steel covered hopper cars is made. The final portion of the paper presents an overview of both the laboratory test and road test programs associated with the qualification of the prototype cars for rail service. Glasshopper I and II successfully passed all of the required American Association of Railroads tests including the 1 000 000 lb (c. 454 000 kg) static and compression test and the 1 250 000 lb (c. 567 000 kg) coupler force impact test in the laboratory. In addition, Glasshopper I successfully completed a 6000 mile (c. 9660 km) round trip between St. Louis, Missouri, and Oakland,California",,,,,

Although the precise mechanism of this interaction is unclear, it constitutes a key interface in the plasticity of the adult vertebrate HP. The songbird HP expresses high levels of aromatase (estrogen synthase), suggesting that locally generated steroid may affect excitatory pathways. By using light, confocal, and electron microscopy with antibodies that specifically recognize aromatase and NR, we have 1) mapped their distribution in the zebra finch brain., 2) documented their coexpression in HP neurons, 3) studied the ultrastructure of NR-expressing cells in the HP, and 4) tested the influence of estrogen on the cellular and subcellular characteristics of NR-positive HP neurons. Aromatase and NR are coexpressed in HP neurons. NRs are detectable in presynaptic boutons of the songbird HP in addition to postsynaptic loci. Treatment with estrogen increased the somal size and innervation of NR-positive neurons and the frequency of presynaptic NR. Autoreception of excitatory neurotransmission via presynaptic NR may promote the strengthening of activity-dependent, excitatory synapses, thereby enhancing learning. NR-mediated autoreception may underlie estrogenic enhancement of HP structural and functional plasticity. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",,,"Hippocampus;Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate;Estrogens",,

However, the large extent of structural diversity observed in the lipidome means optimal ion signal for different lipid classes is often obtained in opposite polarities. In this work we demonstrate how new high speed MALDI-MSI technologies combined with precise laser position control enables the acquisition of positive and negative ion mode lipid data from the same tissue section much faster than is possible with other MSI instruments. Critically, using this approach we explicitly demonstrate how such dual polarity acquisitions provide more information regarding molecular composition and spatial distributions throughout biological tissues. For example, in applying this approach to the zebra finch songbird brain we reveal the high abundance of DHA containing phospholipids (PC in positive mode and PE, PS in negative ion mode) in the nuclei that control song learning behaviour. To make the most of dual polarity data from single tissues we have also developed a pLSA-based multivariate analysis technique that includes both positive and negative ion data in the classification approach. In doing so the correlation amongst different lipid classes that ionise best in opposite polarities and contribute to certain spatial patterns within the tissue can be directly revealed. To demonstrate we apply this approach to studying the lipidomic changes throughout the tumor microenvironment within xenografts from a lung cancer model.",,,,,

A light trap is attached to the output of the radiometer to collect the transmitted radiation and to minimize the effect of ambient light.

Sequencing of peptides derived from the purified protein allowed expressed sequence tag sequences to be identified that were assembled to yield a full-length composite sequence whose conceptual translation product contained the complete amino acid sequence of ovocalyxin-32.

High level expression of ovocalyxin-32 was limited to the isthmus and uterus tissue, where immunocytochemistry at the light and electron microscope levels demonstrated that ovocalyxin-32 is secreted by surface epithelial cells.

At 51 d, 30 birds from each room were processed and cut up to determine weights and yields. Beginning at 23 and 30 d, respectively, BW and feed consumption were greater in the Dim treatment. At 51 d, Dim treatment BW was 4.7% greater and feed consumption was 3.9% greater. Feed conversion, metabolic and total mortality, and BW uniformity were not influenced by light intensity. Weights of lean carcass, total breast, fillets, tenders, and legs were from 4.9 to 6.2% greater in the Dim treatment, which was proportional to the BW difference and resulted in similar yields of these parts. However, wings were 9.9% heavier in the Dim treatment, which resulted in greater wing yield. Equal fat pad weights resulted in reduced fat pad yield in the Dim treatment. These results indicate that BW, feed consumption, and most parts weights were increased proportionally by providing 0.1 vs. 15 FC of light intensity via an increasing photoperiod program, and that only the yields of minor parts were affected by intensity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Excluded""}",,,,

In birds, several cryptochromes occur: Cryptochrome 2, Cryptochrome 4 and two splice products of Cryptochrome 1, Cry1a and Cry1b. With an antibody not distinguishing between the two splice products, Cryptochrome 1 had been detected in the retinal ganglion cells of garden warblers during migration. A recent study located Cry1a in the outer segments of UV/V-cones in the retina of domestic chickens and European robins, another migratory species. Here we report the presence of cryptochrome 1b (eCry1b) in retinal ganglion cells and displaced ganglion cells of European Robins, Erithacus rubecula. Immuno-histochemistry at the light microscopic and electron microscopic level showed eCry1b in the cell plasma, free in the cytosol as well as bound to membranes. This is supported by immuno-blotting. However, this applies only to robins in the migratory state. After the end of the migratory phase, the amount of eCry1b was markedly reduced and hardly detectable. In robins, the amount of eCry1b in the retinal ganglion cells varies with season: it appears to be strongly expressed only during the migratory period when the birds show nocturnal migratory restlessness. Since the avian magnetic compass does not seem to be restricted to the migratory phase, this seasonal variation makes a role of eCry1b in magnetoreception rather unlikely. Rather, it could be involved in physiological processes controlling migratory restlessness and thus enabling birds to perform their nocturnal flights.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Excluded""}",,Seasons,,

Life there is heavily conditioned by the water level in the marsh (locally named ""marisma""). It is known that the wetlands are considered as a desertification indicator and a climate change index. The marshes within Donana National Park have a wide extension (roughly 50,000 Ha) and a smooth, flat topography (elevation ranges between 0.8 and 1.8 meters above sea level). Every year, more than 35,000Ha of marisma change from being flooded in the wet season to being completely dry in summer. The evolution of both vegetation and fauna (migratory birds in particular) depends on this annual flooding-drying cycle. Several human activities during the second part of the XX century were carried out in order to control seasonal flooding, and to make the interior of the National Park (NP.) independent from stream contributions, the Guadalquivir River and sea tides. In 1998, other emergency actions were carried out in order to avoid the Park contamination by a toxic waste (mud with a high content of heavy metals) that reached the Park after the failure of the Aznalcollar mining waste pool. In the frame of the National Park preservation project, known as Donana 2005, several actions were designed, including the reversal of some hydraulic works. There was a certain concern about the impact of these measures as the ecosystem balance in this wetland is very complex. The numerical techniques (hydrodynamic modeling of the water flow in the marshes) appeared as a convenient way to simulate the present situation and the intended changes. As water is very sensitive to small gradients, it is mandatory to know the territory in detail and the elevations in particular, as accurately as possible. The Laser Scanning (LIDAR) was used in an aerial survey in 2002, because it is the most powerful technique to build the best DTM (Digital Terrain Models) available today. To georeference the data acquired (hundred millions of points), a geodetic reference frame was established as well as a Geoidal model. The main goal of this chapter is to explain how geodesy, geomatics engineering and hydraulics engineering can collaborate in the simulation of different scenarios. This will contribute in the management of Donana marshes, which is quite a complex ecosystem, and in the decision making about the re-conditioning works, currently in process.",,,Spain,,

The resulting mutant acquired major alterations in the neuraminidase (NA)-encoding segment. Extensive deletions and rearrangements were detected, in contrast to only 12 amino acid substitutions within all other segments. Interestingly, this new neuraminidase segment resulted from complex sequence shuffling and insertion of a short fragment originating from the PA segment. Characterization of that novel variant revealed a loss of the neuraminidase protein and enzymatic activity, but its replication efficiency remained comparable to that of the wild type.

The traditional analysis ignores the contribution of the ties and rail-tie fasteners to the bending stiffness of the track and the nonlinearity of the ballast resistance. In the present paper the analysis of an infinitely long crosstie track subject to a concentrated lateral load is presented. The analysis is based on the new track equations derived by Kerr and Zarembski in 1981. These equations explicitly account for the contribution of the rails, ties, and fasteners to the bending stiffness of the track. A bilinear approximation is assumed in modeling the lateral resistance due to the ballast. A closed form solution for the track deflection is obtained using the new equations, for displacements in the linear regime. A closed-form solution is obtained for the nonlinear response, using a simplified set of track equations.

It consists in the burning of unwanted gas at the tip of a stack and due to its thermal characteristic and the thermal emission it is possible to observe and to quantify it from space. Spaceborne observations allows us to collect information across regions and hence to provide a base for estimation of emissions on global scale. We have successfully adapted the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire algorithm for the detection and characterisation of persistent hot spots, including gas flares, to the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) observations on-board the Sentinel-3 satellites. A hot event at temperatures typical of a gas flare will produce a local maximum in the night-time readings of the shortwave and mid-infrared (SWIR and MIR) channels of SLSTR. The SWIR band centered at 1.61 mu m is closest to the expected spectral radiance maximum and serves as the primary detection band. The hot source is characterised in terms of temperature and area by fitting the sum of two Planck curves, one for the hot source and another for the background, to the radiances from all the available SWIR, MIR and thermal infra-red channels of SLSTR. The flaring radiative power is calculated from the gas flare temperature and area. Our algorithm differs from the original VIIRS Nightfire algorithm in three key aspects: (1) It uses a granule-based contextual thresholding to detect hot pixels, being independent of the number of hot sources present and their intensity. (2) It analyses entire clusters of hot source detections instead of individual pixels. This is arguably a more comprehensive use of the available information. (3) The co-registration errors between hot source clusters in the different spectral bands are calculated and corrected. This also contributes to the SLSTR instrument validation. Cross-comparisons of the new gas flare characterisation with temporally close observations by the higher resolution German FireBIRD TET-1 small satellite and with the Nightfire product based on VIIRS on-board the Suomi-NPP satellite show general agreement for an individual flaring site in Siberia and for several flaring regions around the world. Small systematic differences to VIIRS Nightfire are nevertheless apparent.

We hypothesized that decay fungi associated with woodpecker cavity sites alter the substrate reflectance in a species-specific manner that is visually discriminable by woodpeckers. We grew 10 species of wood decay fungi from pure cultures on sterile wood substrates of 3 tree species. We then measured the relative reflectance spectra of decayed and control wood wafers and compared them using the receptor noise-limited (RNL) color discrimination model. The RNL model has been used in studies of feather coloration, egg shells, flowers, and fruit to model how the colors of objects appear to birds. Our analyses indicated 6 of 10 decayed substrate/control comparisons were above the threshold of discrimination (i.e., indicating differences discriminable by avian viewers), and 12 of 13 decayed substrate comparisons were also above threshold for a hypothetical woodpecker. We conclude that woodpeckers should be capable of visually detecting decayed wood on trees where bark is absent, and they should also be able to detect visually species-specific differences in wood substrates decayed by fungi used in this study.

In addition, noise was an important factor for the chorus onset in greenspaces with higher light levels.

Feed conversion ratio, serum total proteins and cholesterol levels were not affected by the dietary treatments. Serum lipids level decreased significantly (P<0.01) by dietary MSG. Significant increase (P<0.01) in serum uric acid level was observed in birds fed 0.5% MSG. Light microscopic examination of brain sections showed histopathological lesions in midbrain and cerebellum in birds fed 1% MSG. Midbrain sections showed neuron angulations, chromatolysis, fibrolamellation and gliosis. Cerebellum sections showed spongy degeneration and haemorrhagic foci. It was concluded that high level of MSG (1%) has adverse effects on the nervous tissue of broiler chicks.",,,Glutamic Acid;Glutamates,,

At 22 wk of age, Strain X and Y pullets were randomly assigned to one of five groups [processed at 22 wk of age (A), processed after third oviposition (B), processed at 32 wk of age (C-32), processed at 40 wk of age (C40), and processed at 54 wk of age (C-54)] and were placed into individual laying cages. These groups were euthanized at different ages to analyze reproductive and carcass parameters. Photostimulation occurred at 22 wk of age when the photoperiod was increased from 8L:16D to 14L:10D. A light-tight wall partitioned the room into two halves. At 33 wk of age, half of the birds received an increase in photoperiod to 18L:6D, whereas the other half remained at 14L:10D. Body weight and abdominal fat pad weight increased with age. The number of large yellow follicles (LYF) decreased from 8.78 at sexual maturity to 4.60 at 54 wk of age. The number of atretic white follicles (WF) and small yellow follicles (SYF) also increased with age. Although there were no differences in BW, Strain Y had a greater egg weight throughout the laying cycle than Strain X. Peak hen-day egg production was 93.0%, and, overall, egg production was not affected by strain. Reproductive performance and ovarian morphology were not affected by the increase in photoperiod, presumably because peak egg production was so high. Carcass data demonstrated that frame size was determined by sexual maturity, whereas organ weights changed in response to reproductive status.",,,,,

The GSE40807 data profile was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following preprocessing, differentially expressed microRNAs (DEMs) between MTC and healthy tissues were identified. Based on the obtained DEMs, transcription factor (TF) -miRNA and miRNA-target gene regulatory association pairs were predicted. Finally, functional enrichment analysis was performed on target genes of DEMs. Fifteen upregulated and 17 downregulated DEMs were identified. In the constructed TF-miRNA regulatory network, hsa-miR-9-5p was regulated by 9 TFs and hsa-miR-1 was regulated by 8 TFs. TFs of nuclear factor of. light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (NF-kappa B1) and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) regulated 4 and 3 DEMs, respectively. In the miRNA-target gene regulatory network, hsa-miR-1, hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-96-5p and hsa-miR-590-5p were most upregulated. The target genes of these 4 miRNAs were primarily enriched in the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Therefore, MAPK signaling pathway may serve important roles in MTC progression. In conclusion, the DEMs hsa-miR-1 and hsa-miR-9-5p, and TFs of NF-kappa B1 and MYC may be used as biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of MTC.",,,Computational Biology;Thyroid Neoplasms;Thyroid Gland,,

Mosquito trapping was done weekly from June to October with CO2-baited light traps. In all, 186,537 mosquitoes belonging to 7 different genera were collected, of which Coquillettidia perturbans was most abundant. A total of 6,434 pools were processed for arbovirus isolation, from which 193 arboviral isolations were made. These included 109 Highlands J, 71 eastern equine encephalomyelitis, 1 California encephalitis serogroup, 2 Jamestown Canyon, 3 Cache Valley, and 9 Flanders viruses. Our isolations of Flanders virus represent the 1st reported occurrence of this virus in Rhode Island. After the 1999 sudden occurrence of the West Nile virus (WN) in the New York City area, a dead-bird surveillance program was started to test for this virus. Although no isolations of WN were made from mosquitoes, 87 virus isolations were made from a total of 330 wild birds tested. All the WN-infected birds were either American crows or blue jays. Isolation of WN from dead birds marked the 1st documented appearance of this virus in Rhode Island. Significant interannual variation of arbovirus activity in Rhode Island prompted us to examine if climate-associated factors such as rainfall and temperature correlate with virus activity. Total rainfall amounts from May to June were higher than normal in 1996 and 1998. These years showed significantly higher arbovirus activity. Deviations from normal temperature showed low correlation with arbovirus activity during the 6-year study period. Therefore, precipitation appeared to be more important than temperature in predicting arbovirus activity in Rhode Island.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Carrie An""=>""Excluded""}",,,,

The new species is allopatric from, and forms a probable superspecies with, the Rufous-crowned Tody-Tyrant (P ruficeps), the nearest known populations of which inhabit the Cerro Chinguela of northern Peru. The geographic ranges of those sister taxa are divided by the North Peruvian Low occupied by the Rio Maranon, the major break in east-slope Andean forest between Venezuela and Bolivia. The new species and its allospecies, P. ruficeps are identical in color of the back and in lightness and hue of the crown, but are 100% separable in lightness, chroma, and hue of the belly; in color and pattern of the face; and in song. We infer that differences in vocalizations and facial markings would serve as premating reproductive isolating mechanisms should the two forms become sympatric.",,,,,

In this paper, we present a method to model tree crowns and quantify tree shadow effect on solar irradiance received by buildings. Three-dimension (3D) models for trees were constructed using Poisson surface reconstruction method from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) point clouds and QuickBird image data. Tree crown shadows were modeled by applying the improved Inclusion-exclusion Principle. Direct normal irradiance was derived from remote sensing data first and then employed to the calculation of solar energy radiation received by building rooftops and facades. The proposed method was applied to a case study in Nanjing City. Results indicated that tree shadow played an important role in determining the solar radiation energy received by a building. The improved solar potential result provided fundamental data for solar-related equipment selection and installment, as well as building energy consumption estimation.",,,Trees,,

However, it is impossible to acquire photographs covering a large indoor environment from aerial viewpoints. This paper presents a 3D reconstruction and visualization system to automatically produce clean and well-regularized texture-mapped 3D models for large indoor scenes, fromground-level photographs and 3D laser points. The key component is a new algorithm called ""Inverse CSG"" for reconstructing a scene in a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) representation consisting of volumetric primitives, which imposes powerful regularization constraints to exploit structural regularities. We also propose several techniques to adjust the 3D model to make it suitable for rendering the 3D maps from aerial viewpoints. The visualization system enables users to easily browse a large scale indoor environment from a bird's-eye view, locate specific room interiors, fly into a place of interest, view immersive ground-level panorama views, and zoom out again, all with seamless 3D transitions. We demonstrate our system on various museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City - one of the largest art galleries in the world.",,,,,

A molecular taxonomic approach was undertaken based on biochemical, endocrinological, immunological, and physiological criteria previously documented for AFP. These published data were then discussed CONSIDERING their position and relationship in the albuminoid gene superfamily derived from GenBank. The phylogeny of the AFP molecule should prove useful for investigators seeking markers for animal models of human diseases, serological cross-reactivity between AFP molecular species, identification of larval or fetal protein homologs of AFP, and provide strategies for biochemical purification and physiological studies. The phylogeny of AFP in vertebrates was surveyed from the cyclostomata (lamphrey) to the mammals, including sharks, bony fishes, amphibians, reptiles, and birds. A trend was denoted, from lower to higher animal forms, in a size reduction and separation of AFP-like albumin molecular moieties from forms that resembled true albumin molecules. While the primitive lamphrey possesses a serum protein twice the size of mammalian albumin, the bony fishes, reptiles, and amphibians display two ALB-like molecules sharing amino acid sequence similarity to mammalian AFP. However, only one of the ALE-like molecules in the fish and amphibia is glycosylated. Although little has been published on reptilian AFP-like molecules, avian AFP has been investigated extensively following its detection and isolation for developmental studies involving immunology and neuroendocrinology. Finally, a plethora of knowledge exists in mammals following several decades of studies involving the isolation, purification, and characterization of AFP for use in physiological, immunological, and endocrinological research endeavors. In overview, a tendency or trend in down-sizing of an AFP-like albumin molecule and the separation of true albumin forms from a distinct fetal glycosylated form was observed. This seemed to occur in animal classes lacking a free-swimming larval form and possessing either highly differentiated extra-embryonic membranes or displaying a placenta intimately interfaced with the maternal tissues of the uterus.",,,alpha-Fetoproteins,,
