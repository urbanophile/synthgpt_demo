PFOS was found in the livers of 95% of the birds analyzed at concentrations greater than the limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 10 ng/g, wet weight. The greatest concentration of PFOS of 650 ng/g, wet weight, was found in the liver of a common cormorant from the Sagami River in Kanagawa Prefecture. Concentrations of PFOS in bird livers from Japan and Korea were within the ranges of values reported for those from the United States and certain European countries. PFOA and PFHS were found in 5-10% of the samples analyzed. The greatest concentrations of PFOA and PFHS in bird livers were 21 and 34 ng/g, wet weight, respectively. FOSA was found in all the samples (n = 10) of cormorants collected from the Sagami River in Japan. The greatest concentration of FOSA in cormorant liver was 215 ng/g, wet weight. There was no significant correlation between the concentrations of PFOS and FOSA in cormorants collected from the Sagami River. These results suggested that the distribution of FOSA is localized.

Potential effects of PFCs alone and combined effects by complex mixture of PFCs and dioxins and related compounds (DRCs) were also assessed by gene expression profiling using a cormorant oligo array. Perfluorooctanesulfonate, PFNA, and PFOSA were detected in almost all liver samples analyzed, while concentrations of PFHS and PFOA were below the limit of quantification. The microarray data analyses revealed that hepatic PFC levels were correlated with the expression of 74 genes. Real-time reverse-transcript polymerase chain reaction data demonstrated that PFOS concentration was positively correlated with mRNA levels of glutathione peroxidase 1 and glutathione S-transferase alpha 3 and negatively correlated with levels of heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 and tumor rejection antigen 1 mRNAs. These results suggest the induction of antioxidant enzymes in response to oxidative stress caused by PFCs and the suppression of molecular chaperones, leading to reduction in protein stability. Moreover, multiple regression analyses identified seven significant models in which certain genes showed expression levels altered by accumulation of PFCs and DRCs. The regression models explained associations with cytochrome P450 1A mRNA and protein expression levels, and its catalytic activity, ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase of both PFNA and the 2,3,7,8- tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalent levels.

We observed significant temporal trends of perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (∑PFCAs) in all three subpopulations. Concentrations of FOSA and PFOS had started decreasing significantly since the mid-1990s to 2000 in the Greenland and Norwegian subpopulations, consistent with the 3M phase-out, though in sharp contrast to overall increasing trends observed in the Swedish subpopulation. Moreover, ∑PFCA concentrations significantly increased in all three subpopulations throughout the study periods. These temporal trends suggest on-going input of PFOS in the Baltic and of ∑PFCAs in all three regions. Considerable spatial variation in PFAS concentrations and profiles was observed: PFOS concentrations were significantly higher in Sweden, whereas FOSA and ∑PFCA concentrations were similar among the subpopulations. PFOS dominated the PFAS profiles in the Swedish and Norwegian subpopulations, in contrast to the domination of FOSA and ∑PFCAs in the Greenland one. Our spatiotemporal observations underline the usefulness of archived bird of prey feathers in monitoring spatiotemporal PFAS trends and urge for continued monitoring efforts in each of the studied subpopulations.

PFAS production changed in North America and Europe around the year 2000, but impacts on wildlife appear to vary across species and location. Unlike other mammal species, cetaceans lack the enzyme for transforming an important intermediate precursor (perfluorooctane sulfonamide: FOSA), into a prevalent compound in most wildlife (perfluorooctanesulfonate: PFOS). Thus, their tissue burden differentiates these two compounds while other mammals contain PFOS from both direct exposure and precursor degradation. Here we report temporal trends in 15 PFASs measured in muscle from juvenile male North Atlantic pilot whales (Globicephala melas) harvested between 1986 and 2013. FOSA accounted for a peak of 84% of the 15 PFASs around 2000 but declined to 34% in recent years. PFOS and long-chained PFCAs (C9-C13) increased significantly over the whole period (2.8% yr-1 to 8.3% yr-1), but FOSA declined by 13% yr-1 after 2006. Results from FOSA partitioning and bioaccumulation modeling forced by changes in atmospheric inputs reasonably capture magnitudes and temporal patterns in FOSA concentrations measured in pilot whales. Rapid changes in atmospheric FOSA in polar and subpolar regions around 2000 helps to explain large declines in PFOS exposure for species that metabolize FOSA, including seafood consuming human populations.

The polar bear (Ursus maritimus), the top predator of Arctic marine ecosystems, accumulates high concentrations of PFASs, which may be harmful to their health. The aim of this study was to investigate which factors (habitat quality, season, year, diet, metabolic state [i.e. feeding/fasting], breeding status and age) predict PFAS concentrations in female polar bears captured on Svalbard (Norway). We analysed two perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFSAs: PFHxS and PFOS) and C8-C13 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs) in 112 plasma samples obtained in April and September 2012–2013. Nitrogen and carbon stable isotope ratios (δ15N, δ13C) in red blood cells and plasma, and fatty acid profiles in adipose tissue were used as proxies for diet. We determined habitat quality based on movement patterns, capture position and resource selection functions, which are models that predict the probability of use of a resource unit. Plasma urea to creatinine ratios were used as proxies for metabolic state (i.e. feeding or fasting state). Results were obtained from a conditional model averaging of 42 general linear mixed models. Diet was the most important predictor of PFAS concentrations. PFAS concentrations were positively related to trophic level and marine diet input. High PFAS concentrations in females feeding on the eastern part of Svalbard, where the habitat quality was higher than on the western coast, were likely related to diet and possibly to abiotic factors. Concentrations of PFSAs and C8-C10 PFCAs were higher in fasting than in feeding polar bears and PFOS was higher in females with cubs of the year than in solitary females. Our findings suggest that female polar bears that are exposed to the highest levels of PFAS are those 1) feeding on high trophic level sea ice-associated prey, 2) fasting and 3) with small cubs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Included"", ""Catharina""=>""Included"", ""Lorenzo""=>""Included""}",,,,,True,True,True,True,True,True,True

Contaminants may impair the humoral immunity and also influence the antioxidant enzyme activity (i.e. oxidative stress). Moreover, physical conditions and oxidative stress during development may reduce telomere lengths, one of the main mechanisms explaining cell senescence. To examine the potential effects of environmental contaminants on physiological biomarkers of health, OHCs with different 'physicochemical' properties were related to immunoglobulin Y levels (IgY; humoral immunity), superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD) activity in blood plasma, and telomere length (measured in red blood cells) in individual 7-8weeks old nestlings (n=35) of white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla) in the Norwegian Sub-Arctic.

There were no relationships between the contaminant loads and plasma IgY levels. Moreover, differences between years were found for telomere lengths, but this was not related to contaminants and more likely a result of different developmental conditions. However, there were significant and negative relationships between the OC loadings and the SOD activity.

However, little is known regarding the levels of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in feathers and the applicability of these structures for the biomonitoring of these compounds. In the present study, we report the extent to which feathers are suitable for monitoring PFAA concentrations in the blood plasma of an insectivorous songbird model species, the great tit (Parus major), settled at and in the vicinity of a fluorochemical plant in Antwerp, Belgium. For most of the target analytes (out of the 15 investigated), the feather PFAA concentrations near the plant are the highest ever reported in free-living birds. As PFAA concentrations did not differ in the adjacent sites, no pollution gradient with distance from the plant was observed. In addition, the PFAA concentrations were not associated with the age and sex of the birds. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations were significantly higher in P. major feathers than in blood plasma, but for most other PFAAs, these differences were not observed. The concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and PFOA in P. major feathers and plasma were significantly and positively correlated when combining data from all sites but often not at individual sites. This result was likely caused by lower sample sizes at the individual sites and the use of matrices that represent different time periods. Our results suggest that P. major feathers cannot be used to estimate PFOA and PFOS concentrations in blood plasma, except when there is a great deal of variation in pollutant concentrations among sites/individual birds. Both matrices represent different time frames, providing complementary information on environmental PFAA concentrations, as illustrated by the observation that more PFAA compounds could be detected in P. major feathers than in blood plasma.

Results revealed that healthy tilapia exhibited an overall higher (p-value < 0.05) PFAA burden than pansteatitis-affected tilapia across all tissues. Further analysis showed that organs previously noted in the literature to contain the highest PFAA concentrations, such as kidney, liver, and plasma, were the organs driving the difference in PFAA burden between the two tilapia groups.

Wild sea turtles were blood sampled from the southeastern region of the United States, and plasma was analyzed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Mean concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), the predominant PFC, increased with trophic level from herbivorous greens (2.41 ng/g), jellyfish‐eating leatherbacks (3.95 ng/g), omnivorous loggerheads (6.47 ng/g), to crab‐eating Kemp's ridleys (15.7 ng/g). However, spongivorous hawksbills had surprisingly high concentrations of PFOS (11.9 ng/g) and other PFCs based on their trophic level. These baseline concentrations of biomagnifying PFCs demonstrate interesting species and geographical differences. The measured PFOS concentrations were compared with concentrations known to cause toxic effects in laboratory animals, and estimated margins of safety (EMOS) were calculated. Small EMOS (<100), suggestive of potential risk of adverse health effects, were observed for all five sea turtle species for immunosuppression. Estimated margins of safety less than 100 were also observed for liver, thyroid, and neurobehavorial effects for the more highly exposed species.

This has given rise to intense research dedicated to the analysis of PFAAs over the past few years. This work focuses on chromatographic analysis of three PFAAs in fish. The analytes, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), are commonly associated with the production of fluoropolymers.

Similarly to other persistent and bioaccumulative organic contaminants, some PFASs, particularly the long-chain congeners, can be biomagnified via food webs, making top predators vulnerable to elevated PFAS exposure. In this study, we measured seven classes of PFASs in bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) eggs for the first time. The eggs (n = 22) were collected from the North American Great Lakes in 2000–2012. The ranges of total concentrations of perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids (∑PFSAs) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (∑PFCAs) were 30.5–1650 and 5.4–216 ng/g wet weight (ww), respectively. In addition to these traditional PFAS compounds, 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTS; median: 15.7 ng/g ww), perfluoro-4-ethylcyclohexanesulfonic acid (PFECHS; 0.22 ng/g ww), and 8-chloro-perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (Cl-PFOS, detected in wildlife for the first time; 0.53 ng/g ww) were also frequently detected. Bald eagle eggs from breeding areas located less than 8 km from a Great Lake shoreline or tributary had significantly greater total PFAS concentrations (∑PFASs) than those from breeding areas located further than 8 km (p < 0.05).

The seals had higher total burdens (757.8 ng g-1 ww) than the dolphins (439.9 ng g-1 ww) and the porpoises (355.8 ng g-1 ww), probably a reflection of feeding closer to the shore and thus contamination sources. The most striking difference among the species was the relative contribution of perfluorooctanesulfonamide (PFOSA) to the profiles; the seals (0.1 %) had much lower levels than porpoises (8.3 %) and dolphins (26.0 %). In combination with the values obtained from the literature, this result indicates that Carnivora species including Pinnipedia have a much higher capacity of transforming PFOSA to perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) than cetacean species. Another notable difference among the species was that the two smaller species (seals and porpoises) with supposedly higher metabolic rates had lower concentrations of the perfluorinated carboxylic acids, which are generally more easily excreted than perfluorinated sulfonamides.

The trophic magnification factor (TMF) of PFOA was 1.10 for freshwater species and 1.28 for marine species, indicating that PFOA was slightly magnifying. Analysis of carbon source indicated that freshwater species were more benthic feeding, while marine species were more pelagic feeding. Aquatic food consumption screening values of PFOA were modified according to estimated daily intake (EDI) values, which generated recommendations for limited meal categories and the do-not-eat category.

To that end, a mass balance model including rate constants and time-varying water inputs was designed to calculate levels of these compounds in water and sediment for every sub-embayment. Subsequently, outflows and tidal water exchanges were used to interconnect the different regions of the estuary. To calculate plausible risks to population, outputs of the model were used as inputs in a previously designed model to simulate concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in a sport fish species (Cymatogaster aggregata). The performance of the model was evaluated by applying it to the specific case of San Francisco Bay, (California, USA), using 2009 sediment and water sampled concentrations of PFOA and PFOS in North, Central and South regions. Concentrations of these compounds in the Bay displayed exponential decreasing trends, but with different shapes depending on region, compound, and compartment assessed. Nearly stable PFOA concentrations were reached after 50 years, while PFOS needed close to 500 years to stabilize in sediment and fish. Afterwards, concentrations stabilize between 4 and 23 pg/g in sediment, between 0.02 and 44 pg/L in water, and between 7 and 104 pg/g wet weight in fish, depending on compound and region.

PFCs were not adversely associated with demographic parameters, while the most persistent OCs; notably PCB and p,p′-DDE, were adversely associated with early chick survival, and adult return rate.

Sediment, blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and liver from plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), flounder (Platichthys flesus) and eel (Anguilla anguilla) were analysed for the freshwater and marine environments. The results obtained show a diffuse PFCs contamination of the Danish environment with concentrations similar to those measured in other countries with the absence of primary contamination sources such as fluorochemical production. PFOS and PFOA were generally the most dominating PFCs measured in both point sources and the aquatic environments. PFCs were found in both inflow and outflow water and sewage sludge from municipal and industrial wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), indicating that WWTPs can be significant sources to PFCs in the environment. This is also reflected in the locally elevated PFCs concentrations found in fish like eels from shallow freshwater and marine areas. However, the highest PFCs concentrations found in fish in this study was in plaice from the Skagerrak (156 ng/g wet weight PFOS), but it is unknown if this can be related to significant sources in the North Sea region or to differences between species. The concentrations of PFCs were below the detection limit in all analysed freshwater and marine samples of sediment and mussels. Despite the relatively low PFCs concentrations measured in marine fish, the high bioaccumulation potential of PFCs, particularly PFOS, may lead to high concentrations of PFCs in marine mammals as shown by previous investigations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The method described herein requires a reduced sample amount (25 μL) and involves rapid and simple sample preparation (protein precipitation with acetonitrile but without acidification) prior to analysis by on-line solid phase extraction (Oasis HLB sorbent) coupled to high performance liquid chromatography negative electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The optimization was conducted using experimental designs to account for potential interactions between variables. Out of the 26 target analytes, 23 compounds showed excellent accuracy (± 25% of the expected values). Intermediate precision and matrix effects remained acceptable for most analytes thanks to efficient internal standardization. A human serum standard reference material (NIST SRM 1957) was included in the validation scheme to evaluate method trueness, which proved satisfactory (│Z-scores│&lt;2 for most compounds). Notwithstanding the small initial sample intake, limits of detection as low as 0.003–0.1 ng g−1 plasma were obtained.

Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) were determined by GC-ECD. Biotic and abiotic samples showed the same POPs distribution pattern: OCPs &gt; PCBs &gt; PBDEs.

The occurrence of PCBs and PBDEs shows the ubiquity of these pollutants in the area. Histological lesions in gills and liver of O. bonariensis and O. jenynsii, might be related with the high levels of endosulfans in these organs.

Relative egg size and mass varies across species, reflecting differences in maternal investment. This variability may affect the maternal transfer of anthropogenic pollutants including lipophilic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and protein-associated per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and mercury (Hg). We conducted a meta-analysis on seabirds and investigated whether interspecies variation in maternal investment contributes toward skewed pollutant concentration ratios between males and females, as Cmale/Cfemale (80 studies). Overall concentrations of PCBs and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) were 1.6 and 1.3 times higher, respectively, in males than females, whereas mercury was similar between sexes. Few studies compared females and eggs (n = 6), highlighting a knowledge gap. We found that an increasing maternal investment as a clutch-to-female mass ratio resulted in lower PCB concentrations in females than in males during the incubation period, but no sex-specific differences were observed for mercury and PFOS. Egg production is both a lipid dominated and protein-limited process. Females transfer lipophilic pollutants more easily to eggs, and to a higher degree with increasing maternal investment, but feeding ecology may be more important.

It has been suggested that peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), black-crowned night herons (Nycticorax nycticorax), white-faced ibises (Plegadis chihi), various migratory waterfowl and shorebirds, and other avian species accumulate higher concentrations of POPs while on migration or on their wintering grounds in Latin America. Nonetheless, the data obtained thus far are limited, and there is no clear pattern to suggest that such accumulation occurs on a widespread basis. In this review wildlife contaminant studies conducted along the U.S.-Mexico border and throughout Mexico are discussed. The results for the most part seem to indicate that no major accumulation of 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)-1,1- dichloroethylene) (DDE), the most persistent organochlorine compound, has occurred or been reported for most parts of Mexico. The majority of the DDE values in birds from Mexico were similar to those reported in birds from the southwestern United States during the same years. More work needs to be done, particularly in those cotton-producing areas of Mexico where DDT was applied heavily in the past (e.g., Chiapas and Michoacan).

The individual and binary combination effects of PFAS on the cytotoxicity, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and glutathione (GSH) levels were determined by MTS assay, dichlorofluorescein diacetate assay, and GSH-Glo™ Glutathione assay, respectively. The results showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFDA, PFNA, and PFHxS individually and in binary combinations caused concentration-dependent cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells. Also, intracellular ROS production was not significantly induced in both the individual and co-treatment groups, indicating that ROS production may not be likely influencing the combined cytotoxicity of PFAS to HepG2 cells. However, the depletion of the intracellular glutathione levels was correlated with cytotoxicity. Moreover, the factorial analysis results showed no significant interactive effects between PFOS + PFOA, PFOS + PFDA, PFOS + PFNA, PFOS + PFHxS, PFOA + PFDA, PFOA + PFNA, and PFOA + PFHxS. Taken together, the results showed that both individual and combined PFAS could induce concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and depletion of GSH levels, but could not induce significant increases in ROS production at the concentration range tested. Overall, these results provided valuable toxicological data on the combined effects of mixed PFAS that may help to better assess their human health risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Oxidative Stress,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

In addition, we hypothesized that if ingesting plastic is a significant source of POP exposure, then the amount of ingested plastic may be correlated to POP concentrations accumulated in fat. To address our objectives we compared POP concentrations in fat samples to previously described amounts of ingested plastic from the same turtles. Fat samples from 25 Pacific pelagic sea turtles [2 loggerhead (Caretta caretta), 6 green (Chelonia mydas) and 17 olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea) turtles] were analyzed for 81 polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), 20 organochlorine pesticides, and 35 brominated flame-retardants. The olive ridley and loggerhead turtles had higher ΣDDTs (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and metabolites) than ΣPCBs, at a ratio similar to biota measured in the South China Sea and southern California. Green turtles had a ratio close to 1:1. These pelagic turtles had lower POP levels than previously reported in nearshore turtles. POP concentrations were unrelated to the amounts of ingested plastic in olive ridleys, suggesting that their exposure to POPs is mainly through prey. In green turtles, concentrations of ΣPCBs were positively correlated with the number of plastic pieces ingested, but these findings were confounded by covariance with body condition index (BCI). Green turtles with a higher BCI had eaten more plastic and also had higher POPs.

Both PFOS and PFOA are polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs), man-made compounds that are persistent in the environment and humans; some PFCs have shown adverse effects in laboratory animals. Here we describe the application of a simple one compartment pharmacokinetic model to estimate total intakes of PFOA and PFOS for the general population of urban areas on the east coast of Australia. Key parameters for this model include the elimination rate constants and the volume of distribution within the body. A volume of distribution was calibrated for PFOA to a value of 170ml/kgbw using data from two communities in the United States where the residents' serum concentrations could be assumed to result primarily from a known and characterized source, drinking water contaminated with PFOA by a single fluoropolymer manufacturing facility. For PFOS, a value of 230ml/kgbw was used, based on adjustment of the PFOA value. Applying measured Australian serum data to the model gave mean±standard deviation intake estimates of PFOA of 1.6±0.3ng/kgbw/day for males and females >12years of age combined based on samples collected in 2002–2003 and 1.3±0.2ng/kg bw/day based on samples collected in 2006–2007.

Certain PFAS are regulated or voluntarily limited due to concern about environmental persistence and adverse health effects, including thyroid disease and dyslipidemia. The major source of PFAS exposure in the general population is thought to be consumption of seafood. Objectives: In this analysis we examine PFAS levels and their determinants, as well as associations between PFAS levels and self-reported fish and shellfish consumption, using a representative sample of the U.S. population. Methods: Data on PFAS levels and self-reported fish consumption over the past 30 days were collected from the 2007-2008, 2009-2010, 2011-2012, and 2013-2014 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Twelve different PFAS were measured in serum samples from participants. Ordinary least squares regression models were used to identify factors (demographic characteristics and fish consumption habits) associated with serum PFAS concentrations. Additional models were further adjusted for other potential exposures including military service and consumption of ready-to-eat and fast foods. Results: Seven PFAS were detected in at least 30% of participants and were examined in subsequent analyses (PFDA, PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, MPAH, PFNA, PFUA). The PFAS with the highest concentrations were PFOS, followed by PFOA, PFHxS and PFNA (medians of 8.3, 2.7, 1.5 and 1.0 ng/mL). Fish consumption was generally low, with a median of 1.2 fish meals and 0.14 shellfish meals, reported over the past 30 days. After adjusting for demographic characteristics, total fish consumption was associated with reduced MPAH, and with elevated PFDE, PFNA and PFuDA. Shellfish consumption was associated with elevations of all PFAS examined except MPAH. Certain specific fish and shellfish types were also associated with specific PFAS. Adjustment for additional exposure variables resulted in little to no change in effect estimates for seafood variables. Conclusions: PFAS are emerging contaminants with widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects. In the general population, fish and shellfish consumption are associated with PFAS levels, which may indicate an avenue for education and outreach.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

The present study characterized a novel member of fosA gene located on a plasmid from Escherichia coli. Materials and Methods: A fosfomycin-resistant E. coli isolate PK9 was recovered from a chicken meat sample in 2018. The presence of fosA genes was detected by PCR and sequencing. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), conjugation, and cloning were performed to identify the mechanism responsible for fosfomycin resistance. Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing was carried out to characterize the plasmid carrying fosfomycin resistance gene and the genetic context of the novel fosA variant. Results: A novel fosA gene with significant homology (>98%) with fosA6 and fosA5 genes was identified by WGS and was named fosA10. FosA10 shared 56.1% to 98.6% amino acid sequence identity with other reported plasmid-mediated FosA enzymes. Fosfomycin resistance and fosA10 gene were successfully transferred to E. coli C600 by conjugation. Cloning confirmed that FosA10 could confer fosfomycin resistance (MIC > 128 μg/mL). The fosA10 gene was localized on a 53kb IncFII (F35:A-:B-) plasmid. The ΔlysR-fosA10-Δhp fragment (4328 bp), located between two copies of IS10R, showed 100% identity with the chromosomal sequences of 17 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains of ST664 and one of ST3821 in GenBank. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that the fosA10 gene of E. coli might be captured from the chromosome of K. pneumoniae by IS10, which further demonstrated that K. pneumoniae might act as a reservoir of fosA-like genes acquired by E. coli. © 2020 Huang et al.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,Escherichia coli;Fosfomycin,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

Here, we examined physiological, transcriptomic, and metabolomic responses to PFOA in Mytilus edulis, a model organism frequently used in studies of aquatic pollution. We aimed to characterize PFOA-induced stress responses and detoxification mechanisms. PFOA exposure significantly altered antioxidant enzyme activity levels and the abundances of lipid peroxidation products. In addition, transcriptomic analysis indicated that several genes associated with oxidative stress and detoxication were differentially expressed after PFOA exposure.

However, human health risk assessment of PFAS currently relies on animal toxicity data derived from individual substance exposure, which may not adequately predict the risk from combined exposure due to possible interactions that can influence the overall risk. Long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), particularly perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are recognised as global emerging contaminants of concern due to their ubiquitous distribution in all environmental media, wildlife, and humans, persistency, bioaccumulative-, toxic-, and human health-risk potentials. This article reviews the current understanding of the human health risks associated with PFAS exposure focusing on more recent toxicological and epidemiological studies from 2010 to 2020. The existing information on PFAA mixtures was also reviewed in an attempt to highlight the need for greater focus on their potential interactions as mixtures within the class of these chemicals. A growing number of toxicological studies have indicated several adverse health outcomes of PFAA exposure, including developmental and reproductive toxicity, neurotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, genotoxicity, immunotoxicity, thyroid disruption, and carcinogenicity. Epidemiological findings further support some of these adverse human health outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying these adverse effects are not well defined. A few in vitro studies focusing on PFAA mixtures revealed that these compounds may act additively or interact synergistically/antagonistically depending on the species, dose level, dose ratio, and mixture components. Hence, the combined effects or potential interactions of PFAS mixtures should be considered and integrated into toxicity assessment to obtain a realistic and more refined human health risk assessment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

Wandering albatrosses were exposed to a wide range of contaminants, with notably high blood mercury concentrations. Contaminant burden was markedly influenced by latitudinal foraging habitats (inferred from blood δ13C values), with individuals feeding in warmer subtropical waters having lower concentrations of pesticides, but higher concentrations of mercury, than those feeding in colder subantarctic waters. Sexual differences in contaminant burden seemed to be driven by gender specialization in feeding habitats, rather than physiological characteristics, with females foraging further north than males. Other individual traits, such as adult age and reproductive status, had little effect on blood contaminant concentrations. Our study provides further evidence of the critical role of global distillation on organic contaminant exposure to Southern Ocean avian predators.

The small surface-to-volume ratio of the chamber enables reasonably long experiment times, with particle wall loss rate constants of 0.088, 0.080, 0.045, and 0.040 h(-1) for polydisperse, 50, 100, and 200 nm monodisperse aerosols, respectively. The NO2 photolysis rate can be adjusted from 0 to 0.62 min(-1). The irradiance spectrum is centered at either 350 or 365 nm, and the maximum irradiance, produced by up to 160 blacklight lamps, is 29.7 W m(-2), which corresponds to the ultraviolet (UV) irradiance in Central Finland at noon on a sunny day in the midsummer. The temperature inside the chamber is uniform and can be kept at 25 +/- 1 A degrees C. The chamber is kept in an overpressure with a moving top frame, which reduces sample dilution and entrance of contamination during an experiment. The functionality of the chamber was tested with oxidation experiments of toluene, resulting in secondary organic aerosol (SOA) yields of 12-42%, depending on the initial conditions, such as NOx concentration and UV irradiation. The highest gaseous oxidation product yields of 12.4-19.5% and 5.8-19.5% were detected with ions corresponding to methyl glyoxal (m/z 73.029) and 4-oxo-2-pentenal (m/z 99.044), respectively.

Although new analytical methods have increased the number that can be identified in environmental samples, a significant fraction of them remain uncharacterized. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is the PFAS compound of primary interest when evaluating risks to humans and wildlife owing to the consumption of aquatic organisms. The exposure assessment for PFOS is complicated by the presence of PFOS precursors and their transformation, which can occur both in the environment and within organisms. Thus, the PFOS to which wildlife or people are exposed may consist of PFOS that was discharged directly into the environment and/or other PFOS precursors that were transformed into PFOS. This means that exposure assessment and the development of remedial strategies may depend on the relative concentrations and properties not only of PFOS but also of other PFAS that are transformed into PFOS. A bioaccumulation model was developed to explore these issues. The model embeds toxicokinetic and bioenergetic components within a larger food web calculation that accounts for uptake from both food and water, as well as predator-prey interactions. Multiple chemicals are modeled, including parent-daughter reactions.

In 2016, 124 LFPW were stranded on the Chilean Patagonian islands, offering a unique opportunity to obtain crucial information on the ecology, biology, and genetics of this population. In addition, we examined whether persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and trace elements (TEs) were responsible for this mass mortality. Stable isotopes (δ13C &amp; δ15N) and genetic analyses were used to reconstruct the trophic ecology, social structure, and kinship of LFPW and compared to POPs and TEs levels found in LFPW. Mitochondrial DNA analyses on 71 individuals identified four maternal lineages within the stranded LFPW. Of these animals, 32 individuals were analyzed for a suite of POPs, TEs, and lipid content in blubber. The highest levels were found for ΣDDXs (6 isomers) (542.46 ± 433.46 ng/g, lw) and for total Hg (2.79 ± 1.91 mg/kg, dw). However, concentrations found in these LFPW were lower than toxicity thresholds and those reported for LFPW stranded in other regions. Evidence was found of ΣDDX, Σ7PCBs, and Cd bioaccumulation and maternal transfer of POPs in mother/offspring groups. Nevertheless, no clear relationship between contaminant concentrations and LFPW mortality was established.

Accordingly, PFOS-related industries are significant sources of PFOS to the environment in China, though little information is available. In the present study, industrial sources of PFOS in China were identified and emissions from major related industries, including PFOS manufacture, textile treatment, metal plating, fire-fighting and semiconductor industries, were evaluated. Contribution by various industrial sources and spatial distribution of the PFOS emission were discussed. It was estimated that the total emission of PFOS equivalents in China was 70 t in 2010. Industrial use of PFOS in metal plating was identified as the largest source of PFOS pollution at the national level, followed by textile treatment, fire-fighting, PFOS manufacture and semiconductor industry. At the regional level, greater contributions were made by metal plating and textile treatment in most provinces of eastern China, while in the western part of China and several northeastern provinces fire-fighting was the predominant source. The contribution by PFOS manufacture was considerable in Hubei and Fujian provinces. Total emission, emission density and emission intensity showed geographical variations. In general, the eastern coastal provinces, as the most intensively industrialized regions of China, were characterized by significantly higher emission rates, emission density and emission intensity than those in western and northern China. Available monitoring data of PFOS concentrations in surface water of China reflected a similar distribution Pattern, confirming that manufacture and industrial uses were crucial sources of PFOS pollution which would cause significant risks in the environment.

In the present study, we aimed to measure PFAS concentrations in pregnant women and evaluate sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors as potential determinants of PFAS concentrations. We analyzed eleven PFASs in maternal blood samples (N = 981) collected at 12–16 weeks of gestation between April and December 2012 at Maternal and Child Health Hospital of Minhang District in Shanghai, China. Multivariate linear regression models were used to examine the associations of PFAS concentrations with maternal sociodemographic, lifestyle, and dietary factors.

Pregnant women who were older, multiparous, well educated, passive smokers, with lower per capita household incomes, and had lived in rooms decorated within the past two years had higher PFAS concentrations, after mutual adjustment for maternal sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyles. With regard to dietary factors, intake of red meat, poultry, animal offal, fish, pastries and fried food, and drinking tap water during pregnancy contributed to higher concentrations of most PFASs, after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyles. Furthermore, higher intake of wheat, coarse cereals, tubers, and soy products was associated with lower maternal PFAS concentrations.

The bioaccumulation of PFASs in plants from contaminated sites varied between ng/g and μg/g levels. The 50% inhibition concentration of PFASs for plant growth is often several orders of magnitude higher than the environmentally relevant concentrations (ERCs). ERCs of PFASs rarely lead to obvious phenotypic/physiological damages in plants, but markedly perturb some biological activities at biochemical and molecular scales. PFAS exposure induces the over-generated reactive oxygen species and further damages plant cell structure and organelle functions. A number of biochemical activities in plant cells are perturbed, such as photosynthesis, gene expression, protein synthesis, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. To restore the desire states of cells exposed to PFASs, plants initiate several detoxifying mechanisms, including enzymatic antioxidants, non-enzymatic antioxidants, metallothionein genes and metabolic reprogramming.

While concentrations have decreased since their peak values in the 1970s and 80s, recent measurements have shown that the rate of this decline in Lake Superior has decreased significantly. This modeling study focused on toxaphene cycling in the Great Lakes and was performed primarily to determine if elevated water and fish concentrations in Lake Superior can be explained by physical differences among the lakes. Specifically, the coastal zone model for persistent organic pollutants (CoZMo-POP), a fugacity-based multimedia fate model, was used to calculate toxaphene concentrations in the atmosphere, water, soil, sediment, and biota. The performance of the model was evaluated by comparing calculated and reported concentrations in these compartments. In general, simulated and observed concentrations agree within one order of magnitude. Both model results and observed values indicate that toxaphene concentrations have declined in water and biota since the 1980s primarily as the result of decreased atmospheric deposition rates. Overall the model results suggest that the CoZMo-POP2 model does a reasonable job in simulating toxaphene variations in the Great Lakes basin. The results suggest that the recent findings of higher toxaphene concentrations in Lake Superior can be explained by differences in the physical properties of the lake (primarily large volume, large residence time and cold temperatures) compared to the lower lakes and increased recent inputs are not needed to explain the measured values. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

However, the quantitative assessment of contaminant exposure and effects to aquatic communities is still difficult, limiting the understanding of consequences on aquatic ecosystem functioning and the implementation of effective management plans. Here, multisubstance indicators based on caged gammarid bioaccumulated contamination data are proposed (for metals and persistent organic pollutants, POPs) to map the bioavailable contamination level of freshwater ecosystems at a large spatial scale. We assessed the ability of these indicators to highlight the relationships between chemical exposure gradients and alteration in the abundance of macroinvertebrate populations on a data set of 218 watercourses distributed throughout France. We identified spatial regional heterogeneities in the levels of bioavailable contamination of metals (18 compounds) and POPs (43 compounds). Besides this, a degradation of Gammaridae, Ephemeridae, and Hydrobiidae densities with increasing levels of metal contamination are identified relative to Baetidae, Chironomidae, and Hydropsychidae. We show here that active biomonitoring allows the establishment of multisubstance indicators of bioavailable contamination, which reliably quantify chemical exposure gradients in freshwater ecosystems. Our ability to identify species-specific responses to chemical exposure gradients demonstrates the promising possibility to further decipher the effects of chemical contamination on macroinvertebrate assemblages through this type of indicator. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,France,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False

A partial ternary phase diagram of water/C8F17EO20/C8F17EO3 was constructed at 25 degrees C by visual inspection through crossed polarizers. In the water/surfactant binary system, C8F17EO20 forms an isotropic micellar solution over a wide concentration range (similar to 80 wt %). The micellar solution of the C8F17EO20 can solubilize a significant amount of C8F17EO3, and the solubility increases with increasing C8F17EO20 concentration. With successive addition of C8F17EO3 to the aqueous C8F17EO20 solution, viscosity increases rapidly, and a viscoelastic solution is formed. The viscosity of the viscous sample was similar to 5th order of magnitude of pure water. The viscoelastic solution follows the Maxwell model typical of wormlike micelles at low-frequency region. With further addition of C8F17EO3 the viscosity decreases, and phase separation occurs. Addition of perfluoropolyether oil, (C3F6O)(n)COOH, to the viscoelastic solution decreases the viscosity monotonically until phase separation. On the other hand, when perfluorodecalin oil, C10F18, is added, viscosity first decreases and attains a limiting value before excess oil phase separates out. The viscosity decrease in water/surfactant/oil systems is possibly caused by the microstructural transition in the network structure. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements were performed to complement the rheological data. It has been found that the C8F17EO3 induces one-dimensional growth to the C8F17EO20 micelles.

Low molecular mass (LMr) protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP), a key regulatory enzyme involved in many different processes in the cell, was distinctly affected by anionic (homologous series of n-alkyl sulfates (C8-C14)) and cationic (n-alkyl trimethylammonium bromides (C12-C16)) surfactants. At concentrations 10-fold lower critical micellar concentration (cmc) values, the enzyme was completely inactivated in the presence of anionic surfactants, in a process independent of the pH, and dependent on the chain length of the surfactants. Under the same conditions, the effect of cationic surfactants on the enzyme activity was pH-dependent and only at pH 7.0 full inactivation was observed at concentrations 10-fold higher cmc values. In contrast to cationic surfactants the effect of anionic surfactants on the enzyme activity was irreversible and was not affected by the presence of NaCl. Inorganic phosphate, a known competitive inhibitor of PTP, protected the enzyme against inactivation by the surfactants. Our results suggest that the inactivation of the LMr PTP by anionic and cationic surfactants involved both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions, and that the interactions enzyme-surfactants probably occurred at or near the active site. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,Tyrosine,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False
2134,rayyan-236652580,A Pest or Otherwise? Encounter of Oryctes rhinoceros (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) with Persistent Organic Pollutants,2021.0,,,INSECTS,2075-4450 J9 - INSECTS JI - Insects,12.0,9.0,,,,English,,,"Simple Summary A native, widely spread beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, in Southeast Asia may clean up some of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) for us if guarded in a controlled manner. Some xenobiotics persisting in our environment may cause harmful effects to the living creatures within their food web via a so-called ""bioaccumulation effect"". The encounter of wild creatures with the POPs appears inevitable. Luckily, this study revealed that the proper breeding of the commonly seen beetle could degrade more than 95% of some studied POPs simply by ingestion. The beetle larvae tolerated different POPs at various extents, yet through an acclimation operation, the beetle's mortality rate could be greatly reduced. Even though O. rhinoceros is considered a pest for some valuable corps, its removal of POPs in a natural, efficient and passive (i.e., fewer energy inputs) manner makes this alternative promising and deserving of further explorations. The potential use of invertebrates as bioreactors to treat environmental pollutants is promising and of great interest. Three types of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs), namely pentachlorophenol (PCP), PAHs (naphthalene and phenanthrene) and dieldrin (DLN), were spiked in soil and treated by using Oryctes rhinoceros larvae, a known pest of coconut trees in southeast Asia, and also the indicators of POP toxicity and the fate and degradability of the ingested POPs were assessed. The larvae were tested at various levels of the POPs and went through an acclimation process. Without acclimation, the tolerance limits of the larvae toward PCP, PAHs and DLN were 200, 100 and 0.1 mg/kg-soil, respectively, yet with acclimation, the tolerance levels increased to 800, 400 and 0.5 mg/kg-soil, respectively. Biodegradation rates of all the tested POPs were >90% by week 2, with <5% and nearly 0% remaining in the feces and body of the larvae, respectively. The results suggest that the use of the beetle larvae in soil POP decontamination is doable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Losia""=>""Excluded"", ""Catharina""=>""Excluded""}",,,,,True,True,False,False,False,False,False
